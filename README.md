# Team31
We have created a very simple web application called 'Anti-Boring'. The user simply needs to select a category of activity and the applicatoin will suggest that type of activity to the user.

Technologies used:
Frontend - Embedded JavaScript and Bootstrap 4
Backend - Node.js
Database - MongoDB
API consumed - https://www.boredapi.com/api

We also set-up Apollo Graph-ql client and server. 

The website is hosted at : https://boringtinder.herokuapp.com
and the GraphqlAPI is hosted at : https://boringtinder.herokuapp.com/graphql
